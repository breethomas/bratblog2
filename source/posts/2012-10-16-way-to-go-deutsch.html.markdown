I spoke at the 4A's Create Tech 2012 with David Slayden, founder of BDW,
regarding the talent problem facing many agencies today - in that they
are hard pressed to find the right talent and even harder pressed to
retain it (video of our talk on 4A's Site).  One of our key takeaways
for the room was that it wasn't about how much beer an agency had on
  tap, or even how much money they might throw at a would-be candidate.
  To attract and retain today's digital talent, the first step is to
  realize that today's talent no longer needs the agency, and their real
  motivation lies in making great product.  So for an agency, giving
  today's talent the space to think, make and innovate - requires a
  change in process, team structure, thinking and ultimately - culture.  

  And then Winston Binch, CDO of Deutsch LA and keynote speaker for the
  conference, spoke the following day regarding inventioni.st  (video of
  talk on 4A's Site), the agency's new offer/product structure for
  clients.    And I think Deutsch may have just nailed the
  aforementioned issue right on the head….with a reinvention of
  themselves for a new kind of client.  Way to go Deutsch.   A product
  innovation team within the agency, working with clients in 5 day
  sprints, 45 day cycles and/or 6 month deep dives.  Lean marketing has
  arrived.  Building shit instead of talking about building shit.  Truly
  working iteratively and even defining a new department of new
  resources around the idea of building shit and testing it out -
  inventors.  

  If you are slapping yourself on the forehead right now, and thinking
  "fuck! I wish I'd thought of that!".  Well good.  Because the truth is
  - we should all be thinking more like that.  And here is the thing….
    a lot of people are certainly talking about thinking more agile, or
    talking about how to market iteratively, or talking about how to
    think like a startup to attract today's talent - but most of it is
    just that - talk.  And that isn't to say the talk isn't important,
    but we all know how cheap it can be.  And lately, I think "agile",
    "iterative", "lean" have become the new black in buzz words, with
    nobody wearing them well and all starting to feel like a cheap
    thrill for selling in the latest "digital capability" or for trying
    to attract the latest "inventors."

    But change is hard right?  And all this talk feels a little mad
    scientist in nature, what with experimenting and inventing, agile
    mindsets and lean approaches, what does it all mean in the real
    day-to-day world and why the hell should you care - as an agency or
    as a client?  

    Simple - because you could be doing more on less, if you just knew
    what that meant and how to get there.  It's about turning cheap talk
    into an invaluable process and point of difference. Deutsch is doing
    it. The Aha Method is doing it. What's your take on doing it?
