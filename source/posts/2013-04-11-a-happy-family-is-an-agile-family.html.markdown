Giving parenting advise is dangerous. Although, I have to admit, Bree is
full of fabulous one-liners for using with small people:

"You are in charge of your own fun."
"You are cute, but not that cute."
And my personal favorite: "Stay focused on the task at hand."
That being said, neither one of us is dumb enough to write a blog on how
to run your family. We are, however, smart enough to pass along this
awesome article full of Agile tidbits from WSJ titled: Family, Inc.

Excerpt:

"When my wife and I adopted the agile blueprint in our own home, weekly
family meetings with our then-5-year-old twin daughters quickly became
the centerpiece around which we organized our family. The meetings
transformed our relationships with our kidsâ€”and each other. And they
took up less than 20 minutes a week."
We are also behind enough in our writing that this post is from
February. But, we thought it still worth sharing in the case that you
haven't read it yet.
