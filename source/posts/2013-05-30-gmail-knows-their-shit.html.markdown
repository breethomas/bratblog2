title: Gmail Knows their Shit

It was 2010 and Kat and I were sitting together for Google's Gmail
Panel, “Gmail Behind the Scenes”. Kat was taking copious notes about
their redesign efforts and I was patiently waiting for it to get
interesting. And suddenly, there it was, complete with a curse word and
all, Product Manager Todd Jackson, on explaining how the Gmail team
works said:  

“You can either be a shit funnel or a shit umbrella.”
Thank you Google. Enough said. And what did he really mean?

“...as a product with hundreds of millions of users (and a company with
thousands of employees) there’s a lot of stuff constantly being hurled
at the team — as a shit umbrella, the product managers protect engineers
from getting distracted. It’s not enough to be a “shit funnel” where
they would pass some of the junk down to engineers, they need to fully
protect engineers.” - diTii.com
So why has it taken us nearly two solid years before acknowledging this
little gem and writing about it? Because being a shit umbrella takes a
tremendous amount of energy, time and focus, and it isn’t just reserved
for product owners and engineers. 

  However - even with our day jobs, mom jobs, small independent biz job,
  part-time faculty gigs, continuing-ed students in life and work, and
  then of course our desperate attempts to qualify as authors -  the
  energy required for us to play the role of  ‘umbrella’ still pales in
  comparison to the Gmail team who can boast the following (courtesy
  Kat's Evernote):

  30-1 engineer to product owner ratio
  Approximately 100 person team
  70,000 pages to manage/revamp
  Over several hundred thousand lines of javascript
  Hundreds of millions of users
  53 languages and growing faster internationally than in the US
  And every single stakeholder and user has their own opinion on
  everything
  Yes - the Gmail team is no doubt dealing with shit that flies, rolls
  downhill, and swims up creek without a paddle in volumes of
  ridiculousness that far outweigh what Kat and I manage day-to-day.

  But perception is reality, right? And while we may deal on a smaller
  scale, our frustrations in dealing with shit funnels (clients and
  colleagues alike) are no less exhausting. Because where the members of
  a team, in any position, fail to keep the task-at-hand top of mind,
  fail to prioritize around a common goal, refuse to filter out white
  noise by stopping to think and ask, “why and what is the priority?”,
  or just plain skirt all responsibility in making decisions - well,
  that creates waste.  And as Kat so eloquently stated in a prior BRAT
  Blog post (What the 'Rose Ceremony' and your RFP have in Common) --
  the BRAT abhors waste. 

  And therein lies much of the drive behind our methods - empower teams
  with real tools to deftly navigate through any amount (or anyone’s)
  shit slinging to limit the waste created by progress impeding
  distractions. Distractions that are coming from all different angles,
  business units, stakeholders and the ever-present peanut gallery.
  Avoid lengthy processes, and focus on workable, scalable frameworks
  that empower teams to answer the following critical (and seemingly
  obvious) questions: 

  Visibility - can you even see the wasteful distractions as they are
  flying toward you?
  Mapping - are you confidently empowered to chart  a course that
  delivers measurable results (sans the distractions)?
  Strategy - can you even identify what qualifies as a distraction and
  do you know how to respond?
    Because protecting the team, yourself included, and having the
    means/methods in which to effectively do so -- can be a game
    changer. In the work product. In your professional dynamic. And for
    some of you, it might even make the difference between “work/life
    balance” becoming a reality as opposed to just a shallow headline
    pasted into that job-description.
