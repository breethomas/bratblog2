Kat: You may have noticed that Bree’s been absent from blog posts
lately. That’s because she’s been coming home from her day-job, hiding
in her basement pounding Red Bulls and listening to the Beastie Boys
while coding our sweet new site. Okay, the reality is that she’s been
  grabbing little snippets of time to pair with a few of our favorite
  devs from Mode Set in Denver to learn how to code our sweet new site.  

  Bree: (R.I.P. MCA) Yep, in my vast amounts of spare time, I’ve been
  learning front-end code because: (1) I’m a nerd at heart, (2) a
  well-known control freak, and  (3) Kat and I both believe having a
  coder, no matter how much the noob, brings value and better
  perspective in our roles as marketers and Aha Method founders.  

  Kat: Of course, we’re also stoked to have somewhere to send folks
  inquiring about our Aha Method approach. And, in true iterative
  fashion this site is our MVP. We look forward to learning what works
  and what doesn’t and continuing to improve the content. Drop us a line
  with your comments/suggestions. (On that note, feel free to comment
  within this post on the word ‘noob’. While co-authoring, Bree and I
  got into a spelling debate.)

  Bree: My first lesson in coding was a spelling lesson given by one of
  my all-time favorite grumpy developers (and personal friend).  See
  email chain below (developer respectfully kept confidential) for what
  was definitely a hysterical, if not humbling and sobering exchange.
  The truth is that even when we are in essence saying the same thing,
  the unsaid context is always what trips us up. Shared language and
  shared perspective is how we get to shared success.

  Kat & Bree: And that is why The Aha Method was born.
