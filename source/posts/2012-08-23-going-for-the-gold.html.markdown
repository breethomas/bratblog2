While all of you were watching the Fierce 5 (bad ass little ladies),
catching up on those crazy badminton regulations (no throwing the game
you kooks) and admiring the morning dressage (the royals are just common
rich people after all) I am watching Nike and Adidas.

And I've learned one thing. 

Doesn't matter how much you spend, what you sponsor or how many places
your logo appears - what matters is your ability to tell a story in a
finite amount of time that creates infinite ripples. 

Ad Age reports that:

"As the Olympic Games began last week, Nike's "Find Your Greatness"
landed at No. 1 on the Viral Chart, with 4.5 million views (about 1.7
million paid). Compare that to Adidias, an Olympics sponsor, whose "Take
the Stage" campaign, which arrived at No. 3 on the chart, with 2.9
million views, according to Visible Measures.

Overall, "Take the Stage" has had 5.7 million views (about 1.6 million
paid) since it launched in April, so Nike has nearly caught up in just a
week. Having firmly linked itself with London, many viewers believe that
the brand is affiliated with the games. Last week, Ad Age reported that
an online survey by Toluma Global Omnibus Survey found that of 1,034 US
consumers, 37% identified Nike as an Olympic sponsor, compared to 24%
for real sponsor Adidas."
  
  Here's the point. We won't be the first or the only to talk about
  agile, lean and changing the agency/client relationship. But we will
  do it with a stronger voice. We will do it with more panache, more
    energy and more soul than the rest. 
    
    As Bree would say, "We just f'ing do it".  And, you are going to
    want to do it with us.
