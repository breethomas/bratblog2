Tom Kundig: "The smaller the project, the more human it is."

Thanks to POSSIBLE I got to hear from one of Seattle's most well-known
architects, Tom Kundig, speak about design principles. As he clicked
through stunning images of landscapes and built objects both big and
small, my gears were whirring - his approach to building beautiful
buildings and our approach to building successful digital projects have
a lot in common. Here are a few takeaways that really resonated (many of
these are paraphrased as I  was trying to not look like that jackass who
was texting during a presentation).

Remember the source. 
Kundig made it clear that his source is the landscape of Eastern WA
where he grew up. His respect for the landscape is evident in the
materials and scope of his project. He said, "Small buildings allow you
to sense the landscape." Check out this 1,000 sq foot cabin. 

Likewise, Bree and I try to remember the source of our passion - the
exhilarating, enterprising, adapting landscape of humans and
technologies that make up digital. Our goal is to be a small, nimble
team, teaching other small, nimble teams who can sense the surrounding
landscape and respond with smarts and elegance. 

Right size.
He said "It isn't just about being small, but about being the right
size." He deals in volumes, in the size of spaces. Digital teams deal in
the volume of work, the scope of a 'thing'. Too often clients hear:
agile = small = cheap = job done. When instead they should hear: agile =
small = efficient and focused work = job done right (which is rarely
cheap!). 

The work is about humans.
"The smaller the project, the more human." Kundig tends to do more
residential work because he likes working with a family, with their
story. He said that leads to a lot of inspiration for him. But, even in
his more commercial work he keeps it 'human' by recognizing and
showcasing the work of skilled tradesmen and women.

Apparently, this breathtaking winery, relied on a concrete team who had
only done sewage and water treatment plants before - but they were
craftsman nonetheless. In the same way we teach teams to focus on the
humans involved  - the end-user and their teammate who is a craftsman or
woman. Successful work is about successful relationships and we give
teams frameworks to grow productive and meaningful partnerships with
clients and with their peers. 

I think one of Kundig's last lines of the evening may become the Aha
Method motto: 
Keep it simple, elegant, small. 
Focus on how time will affect it. 
Think about the humans doing the work.

Oh, and when we make it big, I think we'll go with this for our office
space.
