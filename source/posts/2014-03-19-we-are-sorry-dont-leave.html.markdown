title: We're Sorry. Don't Leave.

Let's address the obvious. It's been a really, ridiculously long time
since we posted. We'd like to think you all went through the 7 stages of
grief and have, in the final stage, accepted us for our flaws and are
hopeful we'll return. If you, in fact, did this...then yee-ha pardner!
We're back and want to set things right.

If, instead you took one of the more likely paths of (1) being oblivious
to us falling off the face of the earth or (2) simply decided we were
inconsistent hacks who didn't deserve your time then we'd like to win
you back.

Here's why it's been so long:

Bree learned to code. Last week she said, "This is 10 times harder than
law school". In other words, it's a challenge and very time consuming.
She writes, sporadically, about the experience here: noob-life. She's
also been working on a talk for Rails Conference, "Branding for Open
Source Success".
I'm helping launch a global website and attempting to roll out the Aha
Minimum Viable Product tool across my agencies regional offices. In
other words, it took me a minute to realize we did NOT need to translate
this post into 37 languages (helping improve the BRAT's speed to market
on this update dramatically) although even the EN-US took us a bit!
And, finally, we were diverting effort into the first draft of a book.
But have now decided to roll the book out on the blog as a series of
posts. So, keep an eye out for that this spring.
Here's why we think you'll come around:

Agencies and brands are finding ways to adapt agile into every aspect of
their work and the work is better for it. Check out this post on Medium
by the strategist at a Undercurrent.

"For our past project with Amex, we abandoned the waterfall and did
strategy like an agile developer: 5-day idea sprints.
Yes, we still had brilliant strategy statements and research-driven
insights, except that they were executed in parallel — with our idea
sprints.
The benefits: instead of spending one week on the recommendation, we
spent eight. Instead of recommendations based on research/taste, they’re
based on customer-feedback. Instead of words on a slide, we had
prototypes and MVPs, a head-start on every idea.
In short, we achieved one thing that no waterfall process can: usage."
Firsthand I can tell you that when you have a strategist who is willing
to run sprints alongside your UX, Design, Copy and Dev team, providing
direction and correction as you go, you end up with work that is more
relevant and meaningful. And, just as importantly you have an entire
team that stands behind the work with confidence and conviction - which
means you have a client who can do the same. 

In the same way, Bree and I are making sure we don't get caught up in
our own strategy. We're coding websites and building global brands all
in the hope that the workshops, the posts, the insights are more
relevant and useful to you. So, please, don't unsubscribe. Don't write
us off because the writing will keep coming. It just might be a bit
longer in between and may include more cursing* than normal from Bree.

*To both our well-educated mamas who believe cursing is a sign of
ignorance - we're sorry and we know you don't know how to unsubscribe
anyway, so quit threatening.
