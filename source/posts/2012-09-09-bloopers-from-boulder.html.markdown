We ran our workshop at BDW this last weekend and, as always, had a great
time with the students. (Heads up to those looking to hire their next
digital powerhouse - this year's crew is shaping up to be full of 'em.)
Here are three of the best takeaways from the weekend:

The soundbite: "There are like 400 Terriers"
Yep, that's true. And, odds are you haven't seen every single one of
'em. Likewise, when someone says 'form with multiple fields' you will
have a tough time thinking of all the implications on your own. Does it
need to accommodate multiple languages? How do they do the zipcode in
Europe? When is a drop down better than an entry field? What data
integration challenges does it represent? Do we have to use a stupid
Capcha feature? 

The point: Estimating should be collaborative across teams and
departments. You haven't seen it all, but all together you might have.

The soundbite:  "Let's just go CRAZY!"
This is funny when you are iterating using tennis balls and buckets. It
isn't so funny when you are facing a massive deadline and have a lot of
code to write and creative to comp. If your team is in sync, and knows
what 'flow' feels like, they won't try to 'work harder, work faster',
instead they will be managing client expectations long before the final
sprint.  Oh - and a wine bar never hurts.

The point: Teams get crazy (in a chainsaw kind of way) when they crack
the whip instead of managing the workflow from the get go. 

The soundbite: "Kat, we'll never compete with porn"
Okay, this learning happened over a glass of wine at the end of the day
as we discussed our blog. Apparently, when you type in Bree + Kat +
Brat...you don't get our blog on the first page. You get a buffet of
babes who aren't selling agile...but do talk about being flexible.
(Eeew.) Kat couldn't quite believe that we hadn't done a keyword check
before we launched the blog and tried to ask Bree about metadata, paid
ads, etc.  Bree just laughed and said, if all else fails, clearly there
is opportunity for the brand in other areas.

The point: It's important to not over-plan or over-think every possible
scenario. But do think of the likely keyword searches before launching.
Duh.
