title: Balance is for Sissies. We Want Tension.

I had a strategist friend, Ken, tell me recently that all great brands
have tension in their brand values or characteristics. For instance, if
a brand is both curious and responsible or a bridge as well as a driver,
those  values being somewhat in opposition, then there is a healthy
tension that makes for an interesting, rich, compelling brand that can
stand the test of time. 

That has brought me great peace of mind as a mother.
And great reassurance as an Aha Method founder.

Let me explain:
Women are always talking about trying to find balance between work and
home, self and family. Or, they are upset that anyone even acts like
there is a balance - the idea being that everything is a tradeoff in
which something or someone is suffering  whether you admit it or not.
My guess is fellas have the same struggle. And even if you don't the
next point still applies.

If we are all, as individuals, our own brand, then Ken would tell us we
shouldn't be looking for balance in the first place. We should be
identifying and embracing the tension in our lives that makes us
interesting, beautifully complex individuals. This tension creates a
check and balance that keeps us on point, keeps us sharp, gives us a
certain vitality.

I'm not saying it's easy to manage the tension. I'm not saying it
doesn't require give and take and a very honest look at your priorities.
But I like the idea of my essence, or personality, being crafted by very
dynamic forces. But then, I've never been drawn to boring.

Which is why, one of the things Bree and I juggle along with kiddos,
full time jobs, husbands, PTA, marathon training and reading a good book
now and then - is the Aha Method. 

Leading to my second point:
Our approach is firmly rooted in the idea that everyone who touches the
work participates in the decisions that will guide the work. 

The strategic decisions: what are the business objectives, the risks?
Who are the stakeholders and how will we know if we are successful?
Ultimately, what is really required to deliver on the objectives
successfully?
The tactical decisions: what will it take to build whatever we've
decided on? How big is each task relative to the rest?

This team effort could result in conflict, but we've found that drawing
on agile and lean best practices allows us to uncover and capitalize on
a healthy tension between:

What the client thinks they want (they are part of the strategic team)
What everyone thinks the user needs
And what the team can actually do within the timeframe
It leads to a healthy give and take between individuals (again, anyone
who is touching the work) which always results in the best 'thing'
(website, app, presentation) for the end user and, therefore, for the
business.

If the best brands, (even our personal ones) spring forth from a bit of
healthy tension, I'd say the same is true of the best teams. Hit us up
at the Aha Method if you're in need of a little coaching around how to
create healthy tension in your work life and teams. When it comes to
uncovering the dynamic elements in your personal life you are on your
own - but Bree and I both recommend going for a good, long run...or, of
course, a pole dancing class. NOTE: this post remains gender inclusive
as we've seen guys both on the trail and in the dance studio...the
latter being a very memorable Aha Moment!
